  <summary><b>📝 About Me</b></summary>
  <br/>

I have been developing in Python for more than four years. At the moment, namely 06/25/2022, I am just finishing school, and I already have my successes in this area.

### 📖 My Programming History

To get to the roots, you need to go back to the very beginning, to elementary school.

- It would seem that at such an early stage, where a person is just beginning to develop and does not particularly understand the concept of what is happening, I already had an accurate understanding of what I want from life. From that moment I started to get interested and try to learn programming, but it was hard for me because of my age.
- From elementary school to the end of secondary school, I studied programming in small steps. During that time, I managed to try myself in different fields. I took on everything I saw. He developed cheats for mobile games, created servers for mobile games and has already started making his first websites. But still, the main problem was not age, but that I did not know what to take on, there was no certainty.
- At some point, I realized that with my knowledge at that time, I would not be able to go far and raise my skills to a completely different level. It was at that moment that I decided to study Python and I will say right away - I did not regret it. And now, approaching the end of school, I have what I was going to from the very beginning. I have a clear understanding of what I specialize in, what I should do, work experience and, of course, knowledge.

### 📈 My progress

I will not focus on the very beginning, but will immediately move on to the best years of my training.

- The most productive years for me were 2021-2022. Over the past year and a half, I have mastered a lot of new technologies.
- I learned how to parse fairly complex dynamic sites, create chatbots with complex and thoughtful logic, both create my own and use ready-made APIs, learned how to work with various DBMS, mastered Django, Redis, Docker and object-oriented programming

At the moment, despite the fact that I am just finishing school, I have a project that can bring afk $1,125-1,875 per month and I consider this my small achievement
